## Overview

## Description
Finally, the environmental efficiency can be improved by the DP of “Stage Preprocessed Data”. Staging of pre-preprocessed data reduces the need for recalculations (Vassiliadis, 2009). Schneider et al. (2019) suggest using intermediary stages of the processed data, such as feature stores, to facilitate rapid modeling, as operations only need to be executed once. Further, research focuses on the intelligent calculation of the timepoint to re-extract and re-transform the data when working with changing datasets (Vassiliadis, 2009).
