## Overview

## Description
First, “Promote Data Sparseness in Data Collection” describes the tradeoff between the collection of more data points (e.g., through additional sensors or external server calls), thus increasing the CO2-eq-Footprint and the performance increases associated with this data point (Schneider et al., 2019). This can be achieved by gauging the performance increase of each data point before designing the acquisition (Yu, 2017). On a technical level, the spareness can be embraced by using efficient data collection algorithms (Rohankar et al., 2015; Xiang et al., 2013).
