## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
“Reduce Data Dimensionality” embraces a set of techniques to reduce the energy impact of data storage and processing by mapping inputs from higher dimensions to lesser dimensions without losing important information (Chhikara et al., 2022; Reddy et al., 2020). Therefore, Yu (2017) suggests assessing the quantity of data required for the desired level of performance. Furthermore, aggregating or dropping attributes can decrease the data amount. Similarly, it might appear reasonable to investigate the effects of larger measuring intervals (for time series data) or smaller sample sizes (for cross-sectional data) to downsize the data (Reddy et al., 2020; Schneider et al., 2019).
