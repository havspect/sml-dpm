## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
Previous research endeavors provide evidence that emissions from ML training can be significantly reduced when using servers within selected geographic regions at specific times (Dodge et al., 2022; Xu, 2022). Therefore, the DP “Streamline ML-Model Training Process” describes the optimization of the ML training setup to allow flexible training schedules and leverage renewable energy. An in-depth analysis of different techniques can be found in Xu (2022) and Radovanovic et al. (2023).
