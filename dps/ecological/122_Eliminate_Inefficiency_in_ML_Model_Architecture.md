## Overview

## Description
Subsequently, the DP “Eliminate Inefficiency in ML-Model Architecture” focuses on reducing the energy consumption within the ML model architecture through optimizing energy-intensive parts (Lee et al., 2023; Microsoft, 2023a). One example of model optimization in the context of artificial neural networks is utilizing optimized open-source code. For instance, pre-trained initializations can lead to more energy-efficient convergence (Xu, 2022). Kumar et al. (2020) suggest using profiling software (e.g., Java Energy Profiler and Optimizer) to get real-time suggestions for energy-saving adjustments.
