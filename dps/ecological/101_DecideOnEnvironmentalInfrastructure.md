## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
Second, the DP “Decide on Environmental Infrastructure” focuses on the infrastructure selection to reduce the carbon footprint per computing unit (Martínez-Fernández et al., 2023; Schneider et al., 2019). Practitioners must evaluate whether the computing power should be provided on-premise or in the cloud. Here, shifting workloads to regions supplied with renewable energy and carbon-efficient energy grids leads to a strong decline in carbon emissions (Henderson et al., 2022). Furthermore, this sets the foundation for aligning the energy-intensive ML model training with the availability of renewable energy. Workloads should be scheduled flexibly according to times of renewable energy supply (Schneider et al., 2019).
