## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
The DP “Preselect Energy-Efficient ML Models” focuses on selecting ML models from the perspective of an ML model’s lifetime carbon footprint in relation to its performance (Henderson et al., 2022; Strubell et al., 2019). It is advised to consider simpler ML models such as boosted trees instead of deep neural networks, pre-trained ML models, or transfer learning for ML models (Henderson et al., 2022). Estimates like floating-point operations of an ML model can guide the decision process (Schwartz et al., 2020).
