## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
“Leverage Fair Data Sampling” describes the application of mitigation techniques in the data sampling steps (Fahse et al., 2021; Friedler et al., 2019). Several ML frameworks enable users to mitigate biases by pre-processing datasets (e.g., AI Fairness 360 (Bellamy et al., 2019)). Proposed techniques include but are not limited to oversampling, undersampling, stratified folds, and synthetic data generation (Ferrara, 2023).
