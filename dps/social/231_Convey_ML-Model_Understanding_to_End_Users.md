## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
“Convey ML-Model Understanding to End Users” accounts for the perception of complexity and risk in the ML model prediction due to their non-deterministic functionality (i.e., varying text outputs of large language models based on similar input prompts due to different random number generators) (Baier et al., 2019; Westenberger et al., 2022). Especially since ML models are often user-facing and hence have wide-ranging social implications, the results of the ML models need to be transparent or at least understandable for the end user (Singh et al., 2022; Van Giffen et al., 2022).
