## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
As highlighted in the introduction to this subsection, a holistic definition of fairness covering each element is impossible (Kleinberg et al., 2017). Thus, the DP “Conceptualize Definition of Fairness” focuses on the selection or development of a conceptualized fairness definition for the problem at hand. Whenever possible, existing fairness definitions and metrics should be favored (Friedler et al., 2019). To achieve this, it may be helpful to engage in discussions with domain experts and business stakeholders regarding the application context to determine the essential features to incorporate in the following model training phase (Bellamy et al., 2019; Van Giffen et al., 2022).
