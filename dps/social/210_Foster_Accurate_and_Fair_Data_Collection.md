## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
The DP “Foster Accurate and Fair Data Collection” bundles mitigation techniques within the data collection step to enhance the fairness of the dataset throughout the collection process. Several authors show that it is essential to be aware of biases in the underlying data (Ferrara, 2023; Greshgorn, 2018; Holstein et al., 2019). For instance, in cancer care the goal is to improve prevention. Thus, fair data sets may include additional factors like ethnicity, disability, and other determinants to reflect real-world circumstances better (Dankwa-Mullan & Weeraratne, 2022).
