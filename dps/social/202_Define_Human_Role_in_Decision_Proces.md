## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
“Define Human Role in Decision Process” describes the definition of the interaction between human and ML algorithm (Van Giffen et al., 2022). ML models are indeterministic and, therefore, require a careful interface design between users and the ML model (Amershi et al., 2019). Amershi et al. (2019) propose guidelines to incorporate in the design of ML systems that ML developers can follow. Furthermore, Fabri et al. (2023) developed archetypes of human ML interaction that can supplement the definition process.
