## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
ML models face a multitude of social concerns (i.e., fairness) while simultaneously providing the potential to deliver positive social impact (Ayling & Chapman, 2022; Tomašev et al., 2020). Therefore, “Assess Social Implications” describes the examination of social objectives and potential social risks concerning the ML model and its system boundaries. On the one hand, this addresses contingent consequences that may lead to a socially unfair outcome (Blackman, 2020; Van Giffen et al., 2022). Moreover, an open exchange about the competing objectives of all stakeholder groups helps to find an overall compromise between fairness, accuracy, transparency, accountability, explainability, privacy, and security (Singh et al., 2022). On the other hand, the potential for improving the overall social good should also be integrated into the decision process (Tomašev et al., 2020).
