## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
The DP “Comply with Legal Frameworks and Company Policies” emphasizes the importance of an early evaluation of legal frameworks and company policies. Generally, regulation and transparency needs increase the governance requirements of ML projects, which leads to higher costs and potential legal or ethical issues (Laato et al., 2022). Thus, gathering information and examining applicable laws and regulations for the ML use case is an essential first step (Gill et al., 2022). Establishing an ML governance team as a corporate ethical review board that oversees all ML projects within an organization is advisable to facilitate knowledge sharing (Floridi et al., 2018).
