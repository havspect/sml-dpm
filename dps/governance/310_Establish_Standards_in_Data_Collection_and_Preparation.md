## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
The DP, “Establish Standards in Data Collection and Preparation”, fosters clear internal guidelines for data access, generation, and collection (Dankwa-Mullan & Weeraratne, 2022). On the one hand, missing standards facilitate the exposure of sensitive data, leading to serious financial and reputational consequences. On the other hand, those standards enable the provision of clean, fair, and socially safe data (Gill et al., 2022). Hence, organizations must establish data collection and preparation standards such as data contracts, meta-data catalogs, definitions of fair data, data lineage, and data ownership on a governmental level (Cowls et al., 2023).
