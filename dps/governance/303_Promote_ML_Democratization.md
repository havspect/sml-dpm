## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
„Promote ML Democratization“ describes the development of an ML-related skilled workforce (Ng et al., 2021) to enhance the accessibility of ML (Sundberg & Holmström, 2023). Increased ML literacy leads to an increased number of employees being able to participate in developing ML models and acts as a lever for more diverse research approaches (van Giffen & Ludwig, 2023). One frequently used framework is the four Cs of AI in which low-level and easily understandable information about the ML-model´s concept, context, capability, and creativity is provided to the stakeholders (Talagala, 2021).
