## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
“Establish a Responsible ML-Mindset” describes the company's inherited mindset of the ML stakeholders, especially the business stakeholders, regarding social values such as inclusion and equality within the ML development process. This can be enabled by transferring the company values to the design of ML in a way that values sustainability (Burkhardt, 2019). Concretely, Smith and Rustagi (2020) suggest establishing responsible ML practices as a key performance indicator and integrating them into the objectives at the firm level and in individual performance interviews to drive awareness.
