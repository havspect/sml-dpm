## Overview
<DPOverview />

## Description
The higher the risk for potentially harmful decisions, the more companies should engage in auditing ML models before deployment (Schulam & Saria, 2019). Therefore, “Engage in ML-Model Auditing“ describes the formal audit process of ML models. “Algorithm Auditing is the research and practice of assessing, mitigating, and assuring an algorithm’s safety, legality, and ethics” (Koshiyama et al., 2021, p. 2). To mitigate the risk of inadequate auditing, Laato et al. (2022) propose to connect the deployment testing directly to organizational audit goals, ensuring continuous auditing.
