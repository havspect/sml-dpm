This Git repository hosts the website for the scientific paper titled "Towards Sustainability of AI – Identifying Design Patterns for Sustainable Machine Learning Development". The paper introduces the Sustainable ML Design Pattern Matrix (SML-DPM), a novel framework designed to enhance the sustainability of ML development processes across environmental, social, and governance (ESG) dimensions. The repository contains the website’s source code, supplementary materials, and documentation to aid researchers and practitioners in understanding and applying the 35 design patterns outlined in the paper. The patterns are organized across four ML development phases and tailored for five key stakeholder groups.
